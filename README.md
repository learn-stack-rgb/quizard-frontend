#Introduction:
Quizard originated from a casual conversation discussing an app idea. We envisioned an application that would be beneficial for individuals affected by dementia, a condition where at least two brain functions, such as memory and judgment, are impaired. With further research, we realized the potential benefits of flashcards, which include enhancing memory recall and facilitating active learning. Quizard aims to quench the thirst for knowledge for students and lifelong learners alike by providing an organized platform to create digital flashcards.
